The goal is to create a command-line tool that generates random, secure passwords.

## Introduction

This password generator is a command-line tool designed to create random, secure passwords. It allows users to specify the desired length of the password, ensuring flexibility and security for various use cases.

## Installation Instructions

To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install dependencies**: If a `requirements.txt` file exists, install the dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   If the `requirements.txt` file doesn't exist, consider creating one to list all dependencies for clarity.

## Usage Instructions

To execute the password generator, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the directory containing `main.py`:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/password_generator
   ```

2. Run the script using the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py --length <desired_length>
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   python main.py --length 16
   ```

## Dependencies

This project uses the following libraries:

- **argparse**: Used for parsing command-line arguments.
- **random_password_generator**: A custom module for generating passwords.

All dependencies are part of the Python standard library, so no additional installations are required.
