This command-line tool is designed to generate random, secure passwords using Python. It plays a crucial role in enhancing cybersecurity by creating strong, unpredictable passwords that are difficult to crack.

## Features
- Generate a secure password with a customizable length.
- Command-line interface for easy use and integration into other projects or workflows.
- Utilizes Python's `secrets` module for generating cryptographically strong passwords.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x or higher. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies
- The `secrets` module which is part of the standard Python library and does not require separate installation.
- The `argparse` module, also part of the standard library, used for parsing command-line arguments.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/password_generator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the `password_generator` directory:
   ```
   cd password_generator
   ```

### Usage Guide
To generate a password, run the `main.py` script through the command line with the desired password length as an argument. For example:
```
python main.py --length 12
```
This command will generate a 12-character long password. The script calls the `generate_password` function from `random_password_generator.py` to create the password, which is then printed to the command line.

### Example
To generate a password, you can use the following command:
```
python main.py --length 12
```
Expected output:
```
Generated Password: [YourGeneratedPassword]
```

## Project Structure
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the tool.
- [`random_password_generator.py`](password_generator/random_password_generator.py): Contains the logic for generating a random, secure password.
- [`main.py`](password_generator/main.py): The entry point of the tool. Parses command-line arguments and calls the password generation function.

## Future Enhancements
- Add options for excluding similar characters to make passwords easier to read and remember.
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for users who prefer not to use the command line.
- Allow users to specify the types of characters (e.g., symbols, numbers) to include or exclude in the generated password.
